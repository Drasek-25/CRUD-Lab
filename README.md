# Crud Lab

This was a lab I did at RCA. The goal of the assignbment was to create an object that would act as data storage and then have that object contains functions to deal with the data. I enjoyed this lab alot and it was nice to make something full functioning as aposed to working on something pre-written, or just writting an algorithm.
